# Gradle-Project
This should be a functional base gradle project

#1) Download the .zip and extract the file and rename it to what you want the project to be. For this homework 3 he wants them to be <lastname> sort. so for me its would be stickelssort

#2) Open it and run the gradlew.bat to create a .gradle folder and populate it

#3) Import a new project from the folder that you just downloaded

#4) Choose gradle

#5) Auto import the gradle project

#6) On each java folder, right click them and create your package. first option new/package, then name it -for this homework it is edu.nku.csc364.sorting -Delete the place holder text docs, that was just for Git hub

#7) Now inside the packages is where you need to create the class files, ill create one of the java files included on blackboard for Homework 3. -Right click the package in main edu.nku.csc364.sorting. First option new/java class. Then name it Sorter. -Copy the Sorter.java code off of blackboard and paste it over what auto generated -Do the same with TimedSorter.java

#8) As far as I know, this is all you should need to get started with. You will just have to create more classes for your Sorts

#9) there is an example of the Radix Sort file from the google dox in the image album
